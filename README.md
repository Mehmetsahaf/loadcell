loadcell calibration code
 When this load cell calibration code is used, it zeros out every time it starts regardless of what is placed on top of it. This way, when something like a lid is placed on top of it, it zeros out. When something is added to the container, it weighs the contents of the container rather than the container itself. This way, it calibrates itself every time it starts and there is no need for you to calibrate it manually.
